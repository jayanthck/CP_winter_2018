For January!
Please implement bank.transfer logic
- in case there is not enough money, the transfer method should search through
other accounts that belong to the same customer and if it finds one that contains enough money
perform the transfer and displaying a warning to the user.

You might need to implement a helper method "findAccountsByCustomer" that will return
a list of accounts that belong to the same customer.
